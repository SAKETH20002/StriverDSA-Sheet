**Problem Statement:**
- Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the left by one.



**Note:**
- There is no need to return anything, just modify the given array.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
	- Input:
		```
		nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		```
	- Output:
		```
		[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
		```
	- Explanation:
		- Initially, `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

    Rotating once to left -> nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
**Example 2:**
 
  -Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 6]
    ```
  - Output: [0, 3, 6, -1]
    ```
  - Explanation:
    ```
      -Initially, nums = [-1, 0, 3, 6]

Rotating once to left -> nums = [0, 3, 6, -1]
